By the pricking of my thumbs, The course of true love never did run smooth.  To-day my Lord of Amiens and 
myself Did steal behind him as he lay along Under an oak whose antique root peeps out Upon the brook that 
brawls along this wood!  To the which place a poor sequest'red stag, That from the hunter's aim had ta'en 
a hurt, Did come to languish; and, indeed, my lord, The wretched animal heav'd forth such groans That 
their discharge did stretch his leathern coat Almost to bursting; and the big round tears Cours'd one 
another down his innocent nose In piteous chase; and thus the hairy fool, Much marked of the melancholy 
Jaques, Stood on th' extremest verge of the swift brook, Augmenting it with tears.
 Invest me in my motley; give me leave To speak my mind, and I will through and through Cleanse the 
foul body of th' infected world, If they will patiently receive my medicine.
