Tony, listen to me. Thor’s gone. Thanos is coming. It doesn’t matter who you’re talking to or not. Hang 
on, kid.   You’re quite the fighter, Gamora. Come. Let me help you.  Everyone in the Galaxy knows you’d 
sell your own brother if you thought it would add the slightest trinket to your pathetic collection.
I know you have the Reality Stone. Giving it to me will spare you a great deal of suffering. Alright, 
back up, Sam. You’re gonna get your wings singed.
